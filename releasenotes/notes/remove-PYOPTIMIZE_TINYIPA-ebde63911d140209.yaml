    Removes support for ``PYOPTIMIZE_TINYIPA``, which now causes the TinyIPA
    image to be approximately 5 MB larger. This was due to an incompatibility
    with the ``oslo.privsep`` library dependency on ``pycparser`` which cannot
    load into precompiled python programs where the original source embedded
    documentation is not present.
