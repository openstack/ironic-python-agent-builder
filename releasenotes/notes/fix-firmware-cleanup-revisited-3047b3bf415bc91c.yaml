    Fixes firmware cleanup to be a bit more defensive and also be more
    open to allowing for "glob expansion" as it relates to cleaning up files.
    Ultimately this change fixes firmware cleanup so remnents are not left
    in the image where previously some artifacts were not deleted due to
    prior defensiveness in the cleanup logic. The net result is smaller
    images for booting IPA.
