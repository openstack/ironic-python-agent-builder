    Fixes the DHCP-less usage path by default through the simple-init element
    being enabled as a diskimage-builder dependency by default. This change was
    previously reverted to allow time to resolve bugs in the guard rail
    logic. Initalization of configuration drive configuration with simple-init
    is now handled appropriately.
